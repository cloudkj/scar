SCAR: 1-click static website deployment on AWS
==============================================

Tired of reading outdated blog posts or combing through verbose AWS
documentation just to figure out how to deploy your blog? Deploying static
websites on AWS shouldn't be so *scar*y.

**SCAR** is a deployment stack that make it easy for you to deploy a
static website with a custom domain, SSL, and a CDN. All you need is an AWS
account to get started in three simple steps:

Quick Start
-----------

#### 1. Launch a new stack using the AWS console to create all the required resources

[![Launch stack](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cloudformation-examples/cloudformation-launch-stack.png)](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1#/stacks/new?stackName=SCAR&templateURL=https://s3.amazonaws.com/cloudkj/scar_base_template.json)

#### 2. Update the settings at your domain registrar to use the Route 53 name servers

Find the name servers from your newly created [Route 53 hosted zone](https://console.aws.amazon.com/route53/home?#hosted-zones:),
then update the [name server settings at your registrar](#name-server-settings).

#### 3. Validate the domain for your new [ACM certificate](https://console.aws.amazon.com/acm/home)

Find and expand the details of the certificate for your domain in the AWS console, then click the
*"Create record in Route 53"* buttons in the two prompts for validation.

**_That's all, folks!_**

Use the [CloudFormation](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home)
console to check the status of the stack. If everything went smoothly, the
stack deployment event timeline should look something like this:

After the stack has been created and deployed, you can upload the contents of
your website directly with the [S3 console](https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/home),
or use the [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) for programmatic control.

Stack

**SCAR** is a deployment stack for static websites running entirely on AWS, using **S**3,
**C**loudFront, **A**mazon Certificate Manager, and **R**oute 53. For a given
domain such as `example.com`, the default SCAR stack will create the following:

* Two S3 buckets, one for storing the contents of your static website
  (`www.example.com`) and another for redirecting requests for the apex domain
  (`example.com`) to the `www` subdomain.
* Two CloudFront distributions, one for each S3 bucket.
* One ACM public SSL/TLS certificate for both `example.com` and `*.example.com`
* One Route 53 hosted zone, with an `A` record for each CloudFront distribution.

The behavior for the default SCAR stack is to redirect all requests for the apex
domain to the `www` subdomain, and to redirect all `http` requests to `https`.
All content will be stored in and served out of the `www` S3 bucket.

Additional stacks with slight variations from the default stack are also
available:

| Behavior | Default | WWW->Apex | Apex only |
|----------|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Apex domain requests | Redirect to `www` | | |
| `www` subdomain requests | | Redirect to apex domain | N/A |
| `http` requests | Redirect to `https` | Redirect to `https` | Redirect to `https` |

FAQ
---

### How much will this cost?

For most sites, it will likely cost less than $1 per month. The cost for a Route 53 hosted zone is fixed at $0.50/month; the remaining CloudFront and S3 costs depend on the levels of traffic, but typically amount to a few cents for small levels of traffic.

### What tool did you use to draw the diagram above?

The [AWS CloudFormation Designer tool](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/designer/home) allows drag-and-drop creation of templates, and also creates diagrams from existing JSON or YAML template files.
